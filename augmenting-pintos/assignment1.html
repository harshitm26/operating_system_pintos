<h1>Assignment 1: Message Queues</h1>

<b>Deadline: <u>28th August, 2012 (IST) </u></b> 
<br> <br>
A <b>penalty of 20% per day</b> would be imposed for late submission.
<br><br>
This assignment is to be implemented in <b>three</b> person teams.


<h2>Objective</h2>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
Read, understand and summarize the POSIX message queues. A good place to begin is <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/7/mq_overview">mq_overview</a>.

<h3>Part 2</h3>
You are required to implement a subset of the POSIX interface to the 
message queues in Pintos. The following functions (with the exact 
prototype as provided in the POSIX interface) must be implemented:
<br>
<tt>
<br>
<table frame="BOX" rules="NONE" border="3">
<tbody><tr><td>
<br>
mqd_t mq_open(const char *name, int oflag);
<br>
<br>
int mq_send(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr, size_t msg_len, unsigned msg_prio);
<br>
<br>
ssize_t mq_receive(mqd_t mqdes, char *msg_ptr, size_t msg_len, unsigned *msg_prio);
<br>
<br>
int mq_close(mqd_t mqdes);
<br>
<br>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</tt>
<br>

Note that the above functions must be implemented as system calls in Pintos. The parameter <tt>name</tt> in <tt>mq_open()</tt>
 may be any string to serve as a common identity for a message queue 
(i.e. it need not be a file-system path as required by the POSIX calls).

<h3>Part 3</h3>
Use your (above) implementation of message queues in Pintos to solve the Producer-Consumer problem (discussed in class).


<h2>Deliverables</h2>

The Assignment is to be submitted in <tt>{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}.tar.gz</tt> format. The compressed file should contain following -
<ul>
<li><b>Source Code: </b>Complete Pintos source code <b><i>after cleaning off all binaries</i></b> (<b><i>do not include the simulators</i></b>).
 
The directory structure inside the archive should be 
"{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/code/*". Your main program
 should be saved as 
"{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/newprogs/assignment1.c" 
inside the archive. 

</li><li><b>Report: </b>A <b><i>maximum of five page</i></b> PDF file 
that briefly describes a brief summary of POSIX message queues and your 
implementation in Pintos. The report should be saved as 
"{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/report.pdf".
</li></ul>
<h2>Additional Instructions</h2>
<li>The total size of submission <b><i>should not exceed 1MB</i></b>.</li>
<li>The quality of both the source code and the report would affect your marks.</li> 
<li><b><i>Points may be deducted for not following the submission conventions</i></b>.</li>

<br>
<table frame="BOX" rules="NONE" border="3">
<tbody><tr><td>
<b><i>Discussion is healthy, copying is not</i></b>. You are encouraged 
to discuss the assignments, but you must implement the assignments 
individually (within your team). It is fairly easy to detect copying 
automatically. 
<b>If any two submissions are found with "similar" pieces of code, the 
respective students will be failed in the course (with no concern as to 
who was the "source").</b> 
It is your responsibility to protect your assignment from copying, and no pleas regarding the same would be heeded to.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<br>

<b><i>Bonus Points</i></b> may be awarded for innovative ideas.


<h2>Effort declaration</h2>
You need to provide a declaration of the effort you put in this 
assignment. For the same, you must fill in the entry corresponding to 
assignment #1 and carry it to your viva. The effort declaration form can
 be found <a href="http://web.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/subhajit/courses/CS330_Jul2012/EffortSheet.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Submission details</h2>
You should mail your submission (as per the guidelines provided above) <b>to your assigned TA</b>. (Each team will be assigned a TA who will perform the grading of your submissions.)

<h2>Queries</h2>
Feel free to contact me (in person or via email) or meet your TAs about any queries that you may have.
